## Background
This project came from my pain-point when I'm a Python teacher at Algorithmics school. There're so many classes that I teach so I want to record there progress of each courses and also calculate the income that I got from each class. Currently I need to store all of my class history, update the data and calculate teaching fee by Microsoft Excel which doesn't fully satisfy my need. I still need to do something manually such as changing class status and rearrange the data by myself. So I decided to create a web-app to slove all of these problem and include some of the features that I might need in the future too. 

(I also think that this project will be a great start for me to learn web development.)

## Features

### Main features

- Show list of the class, including their information and status (active/inactive)
